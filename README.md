# MIT-6.0001-Problem-Set-Answers
My answers to the problem sets from MIT 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science Using Python) which can be found at the following link:
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm

All problem sets are included aside from Problem Set 5, which is no longer functional due to issues with feedparser.py and triggers.txt.
